To hack on InfoLister you need to check out other packages from git:

    git clone git://github.com/nickolay/addon-sdk.git -b bug641215-xul-extensions-v2 addon-sdk/
    git clone git://github.com/nickolay/jetpack-httpd.git infolister/packages/jetpack-httpd/

To run tests or run the target application with InfoLister installed, you'll need to use
the 'cfx' tool from the Addon SDK (see https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/latest/docs/ ):

    cd addon-sdk
    . bin/activate
    cd ../infolister
    cfx -a firefox -b <path to firefox> run

You can use 'test' instead of 'run' to run the test suite, or 'xpi' to generate the XPI.

I find useful to develop using a permanent Firefox profile instead of a temporary one
cfx uses by default. This can be done by adding this parameter to the cfx command line:

    --profiledir <absolute path to initially empty folder>

Example start scripts I use on Mac OS X are checked into the root of this repository (*.sh).
